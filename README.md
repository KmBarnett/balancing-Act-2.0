## General info

MF Trips is an application that allows users to book and plan trips as well as allows for agents to approve or deny trips. This project was created for the final exercise in Front End Engineering Module 2 at _Turing School of Software and Design_ This project demonstrates a comprehension of __TDD__ _test driven development_, __object oriented programming, data structure__ and __analysis__, as well as DOM creation around the analyzed data.

## Learning Goals

* Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
* Work with an API to send and receive data
* Solidify the code review process
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Setup

1. Navigate to the project repository (repo) on GitHub (https://github.com/infamouskeyduster/fitlit-starter-kit). Then, click the __green__ button that reads _'clone or download'_.
2. Navigate to the CLI (Terminal) on your machine and enter: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]` â€“ replace what is in the [] with the cloned URL and whatever you would like to call the repo.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).
5. Go to http://localhost:8080/
