## General info

An application built with Jquery/JavaScript, Webpack, & Sass that is a redo of the first project I completed. It meant to act as a budget tracking application where a user can log and track their purchases. The goal of this application was to show how far I have come from the first days learning to code.

My Main Focus
1. Responsive Design for smaller screens 
* Tablets
* Large Phones
2. UX/UI 
* Intuitive 
3. Legacy Code Base

## Setup

1. Navigate to the project repository (repo) on GitHub. Then, click the __green__ button that reads _'clone or download'_.
2. Navigate to the CLI (Terminal) on your machine and enter: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]` â€“ replace what is in the [] with the cloned URL and whatever you would like to call the repo.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).
5. Go to http://localhost:8080/
